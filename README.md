## groovy.vim

Groovy syntax files for the almight vim editor.

## About
This is a fork of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=945

Syntax file for the Groovy programming language. It relies on the java.vim syntax file.

I was inspired by java.vim and ruby.vim syntax definition, so I thank the authors of those scripts.
